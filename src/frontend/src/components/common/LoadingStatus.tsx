/**
 * The announcement half of a loading placeholder (UI-NFR-002, issue #1324).
 *
 * The pattern this replaces was `<div aria-busy="true" aria-label="Loading …">`,
 * repeated at ten sites. A `<div>` maps to `generic`, ARIA prohibits naming a
 * generic element, and the name is therefore **dropped** — a screen-reader user
 * got no announcement at all, which is the entire purpose of the element. axe
 * reports it as `aria-prohibited-attr` (serious), but only while the skeleton
 * stands, so a scan that waits for the page to settle never sees it.
 *
 * Three things about this shape were measured in Chrome's accessibility tree
 * rather than assumed, and each of them would be easy to "simplify" away:
 *
 * 1. **`role="status"` lives here, not on the busy wrapper.** `aria-busy="true"`
 *    tells assistive technology it may defer presenting a live region until the
 *    updates finish — and this placeholder is removed rather than un-busied, so
 *    "later" never comes. Measured: an element carrying both reports
 *    `busy=1` on the live region itself, while a status node *inside* an
 *    `aria-busy` ancestor reports no busy at all (Chrome does not propagate it).
 *    Putting the role on the wrapper would therefore have shipped a live region
 *    that AT is explicitly invited to stay silent about. The wrapper keeps
 *    `aria-busy` — it is the region in flux — and this node does the announcing.
 *
 * 2. **The text content is what gets announced.** A live region announces its
 *    *content*, not its name, so a `role="status"` with only decorative
 *    `<Skeleton>` children inside has nothing to say. Hence real, visually
 *    hidden text.
 *
 * 3. **`aria-label` as well, and it is not redundant.** `status` takes its name
 *    from the author only, never from content: measured, a `role="status"` whose
 *    only child is this text has an accessible name of `""`. The label is what
 *    gives the region a name for a user who navigates onto it; the content is
 *    what makes it announce. Removing either one silently loses half the fix.
 *
 * Matches the live-region convention already used in `ConfirmDialog`,
 * `RecognitionStatusCard` and `LocationAssignmentSection`.
