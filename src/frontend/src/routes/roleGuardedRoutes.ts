/**
 * The route × backend-gate decision table (#1261).
 *
 * ## Why a table and not "we added the guard where it was needed"
 *
 * Adding a role guard to the one route that motivated the issue would reproduce
 * the defect it fixes one level up: a guard applied at the call site, on the
 * routes somebody happened to look at. That is the most expensive recurring
 * failure in this repository — #948 repaired two of four sibling routes and the
 * other two stayed open for months. So the unit of work is not "the guarded
 * routes" but **every** route, each carrying a recorded decision, with
 * `scripts/check_route_role_guards.py` refusing a route that carries none.
 *
 * ## How the decisions were derived (reproducible)
 *
 * Every `require_tenant_role` / `require_permission` / `require_admin_scope`
 * dependency on the mounted FastAPI app (216 gated operations of 789) was
 * resolved by walking `app.routes` through the `_IncludedRouter` wrappers, then
 * joined against the frontend by following each route's page through its import
 * graph to the `src/api/endpoints/*` functions it can reach, and matching those
 * on method + path. Measured on `develop` @ b23f39400, 2026-09-01.
 *
 * ## The measurement that decided the shape of the guard
 *
 * **No route in this application qualifies for a whole-route block.** Every single
 * route that carries a gated write also serves reads that are open to every
 * tenant member by design — reads are open by REQ-049 §2.3, and #1260 kept
 * `GET /identification/history` open on purpose while gating the three writes
 * beside it. Blocking or redirecting would take away read access the API grants:
 * a frontend guard that is *looser* than the API is a security bug, one that is
 * *stricter* is a usability bug. {@link RequireRole} therefore restricts rather
 * than blocks, and no blocking mode exists — an unused mode is a guard with no
 * call site.

 * the page is a read of that action's results.** Those are the pages where a
 * refused member would otherwise start a flow that can only end in a 403, which is
 * exactly the report in #1261. Restricting them removes the header action (via

/**
 * Routes wrapped in `<RequirePlatformAdmin>` in `AppRoutes.tsx`.
 *
 * ## The inventory (measured on `develop` @ 0575d1281, 2026-09-02)
 *
 * The survey is over the **axis**, not over the URL prefix: every frontend module
 * that calls an `/admin/...` path was traced to the pages that import it, and each
 * backend `/admin/**` operation read for its dependency. Five routes reach the
 * platform-admin gate, and only two of them are whole admin pages:
 *
 * - `admin/tenants/:key`, `admin/users/:key` — **listed below.** Every request
 *   these pages make is `require_platform_admin`, including the two `GET`s they
 *   load with. A refused member has nothing to read here at all.
 * - `settings` — the account page **every member owns**. Its *platform* tab is
 *   the admin surface, and since #1385 so is the instance-wide half of the *ha*
 *   tab: every `/admin/settings` operation now resolves through
 *   `require_platform_admin`, and the HA-connection and Pl@ntNet cards are built
 *   only when `canManageInstanceSettings`. (This paragraph used to argue the
 *   opposite — that those routes were gated on `get_current_user` alone and so
 *   offered no platform-admin gate to mirror. That was the defect #1385 fixed,
 *   and the reason went with it.) The route still cannot be guarded on this axis
 *   without taking every member's own account settings away, so it keeps its
 *   domain-axis decision in {@link ACTION_GATED_ROUTES}. Measuring it did
 *   contradict the assumption this entry started from: the `platform` tab is
 *   offered to everyone (unlike the `storage`/`weather` tabs, which are built
 *   only when `canManageInstanceSettings`), and `AccountSettingsPage` derives its own
 *   `isPlatformAdmin` by *probing* the three `/admin/platform` endpoints and
 *   catching the 403 — so a non-admin who opens `/settings#platform` still gets
 *   the tab, with empty cards behind it. That is the same defect on the same axis at the tab
 *   level, and it is deliberately **not** fixed here: it belongs to the page, not
 *   to the router. Recorded in the #1336 pull request as a follow-up.
 * - `stammdaten/species/:key` (reference-image curation) and
 *   `pflanzenschutz/pests/:key` (the pest gallery's curation controls) — read
 *   pages with an admin-only panel inside, already gated on `usePlatformAdmin()`
 *   at the component. Same shape as the action-gated bucket on the other axis.
 *
 * ## What a refused member sees, and why it differs from #1261
 *
 * `<RequireRole>` restricts but never replaces, because the API leaves the reads
 * of every domain-guarded route open (REQ-049 §2.3) and blocking would remove
 * access the server grants. That reasoning **does not transfer here** — checked
 * rather than assumed: `GET /admin/platform/tenants` and `GET /admin/platform/users`
 * carry `require_platform_admin` exactly like the writes beside them. A banner
 * over the page would sit above nothing, and what the member gets instead is
 * worse than nothing: `AdminEditTenantPage` loads without a `.catch`, so *any*
 * rejection leaves `tenant` null and renders `pages.admin.tenantNotFound` —
 * "not found" for a tenant that exists. So refusal renders a replacement state:
 * what the page is, that the account lacks the right, and the way back.
 *
 * That page-level conflation is **not** fixed by this guard, only bypassed for
 * the one caller it turns away. A platform admin meeting a 500 or a dropped
 * connection still reads "not found" — #1390.
 *
 * ## Deliberately not decided here: `admin_scope`
 *
 * `require_admin_scope('management')` on `tenants/settings` and
 * `require_admin_scope('technical')` on `umgebungssteuerung` are a **third**
 * question — additive scopes within a tenant, neither rank nor platform
 * attribute (REQ-049 §2.4). Folding them in would put three meanings in one pass;
 * they keep their current action-level gating and are the next pass.
