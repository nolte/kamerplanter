/**
 * #1261 — the router had no role guard at all, so a viewer reached pages whose
 * primary action the API refuses.
 *
 * Every case here is driven by `ROLE_GUARDED_ROUTES` rather than by a list
 * written out in this file. A hand-maintained list of guarded routes is the next
 * thing to drift: adding a sixth guarded route and forgetting to add its test is
 * precisely the shape of #948, so the table is the single input and a new entry
 * is covered the moment it is written.
 *
 * The pairing is asserted against the **constructed route tree** (`router.routes`),
 * not against the source text of `AppRoutes.tsx` — `scripts/check_route_role_guards.py`
 * reads the text. Two measurements of the same rule from two different artefacts,
 * on purpose: a JSX edit that parses but does not produce the wrapper (a comment,
 * a conditional, a moved `</Route>`) is invisible to the text scan and caught here.
