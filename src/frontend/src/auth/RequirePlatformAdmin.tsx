/**
 * Route-level **platform-admin** guard (#1336, REQ-049 §2.4).
 *
 * Wraps a route whose page is a platform-administration surface — every request
 * it makes is gated by `require_platform_admin`, so a member without that
 * attribute is refused the whole resource, not merely its actions. Before this
 * existed the router consulted the attribute nowhere: any tenant member could
 * open `/admin/tenants/:key`, watch the load fail, and be told
 * *"tenant not found"* — a false explanation, since the tenant exists and the
 * server answered 403 (measured, see `roleGuardedRoutes.ts`).
 *
 * That message has **two** causes and this guard removes one. `AdminEditTenantPage`
 * also loads without a `.catch`, so *every* rejection — 403, 5xx, a dropped
 * connection — ends in the same "not found" render; that half is #1390. What
 * changes here is that a member who may not be there never reaches the request.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second component and not a second prop on `<RequireRole>`
 *
 * REQ-049 §2.4 keeps the two axes disjoint, and the backend agrees: neither
 * `require_tenant_role` nor `require_permission` consults `is_platform_admin`,
 * and `require_platform_admin` consults no domain role. They are not a
 * hierarchy, so there is no single rank to compare and no way for one component
 * to answer both questions without meaning two things at once. Each component
 * therefore answers exactly one, and a route needing both would nest them.
 *
 * ## Why refusal replaces the page here, where `<RequireRole>` only restricts
 *
 * That difference is measured, not preferred. `<RequireRole>` leaves the page
 * standing because the API leaves its *reads* open to every member (REQ-049
 * §2.3) — blocking there would take away access the server grants. On these
 * routes it grants nothing: `GET /admin/platform/tenants` and
 * `GET /admin/platform/users` are `require_platform_admin` just like the writes
 * beside them, so a refused member has nothing to read. A banner over an empty
 * page would claim there is content behind it. The honest answer is to say what
 * is missing and offer the way back.
 *
 * ## "Not loaded yet" is neither a refusal nor an admission
 *
 * The predicate is *"a profile IS loaded and it is not a platform admin"*, the
 * same reading `<RequireRole>` and `useCanCreateCatalogEntry` apply to their
 * inputs. `usePlatformAdmin` reads `auth.user?.is_platform_admin ?? false`, so
 * before `/users/me` has answered it reports `false` for an admin too; treating
 * that as a refusal would flash this notice at the very users the page is for.
 *
 * Passing the subtree through in that window would be the opposite mistake, and
 * `ProtectedRoute` does **not** cover it: the JWT bootstrap resolves
 * `refreshAccessToken` first, which sets `initialized` *and* `isAuthenticated`
 * (authSlice), and only then awaits `fetchProfile` (`AuthProvider.initAuth`).
 * `ProtectedRoute` gates on `initialized` alone, so on a reload or a deep link a
 * plain member would mount the admin page, fire `fetchAdminTenants()`, collect
 * the 403 and read "Mandant nicht gefunden" until the profile arrives — the very
 * sequence this guard exists to end. That window is therefore held on a loading
 * skeleton: authenticated with no profile yet is *unknown*, not *allowed*.
 *
 * It cannot hang there. `fetchProfile.rejected` clears `isAuthenticated` and
 * `user` together, so a failed profile fetch leaves this state, falls through to
 * the pass-through arm and lands in `ProtectedRoute`'s redirect to `/login`.
 *
 * **This is a UX consequence of the backend gate, never a security control.**
 * `require_platform_admin` refuses a non-admin whatever this component renders,
 * and both sides read the same value: `/users/me` reports the very
 * `app.common.auth.is_platform_admin` the dependency raises on.
