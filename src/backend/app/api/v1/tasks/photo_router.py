"""REQ-006 — task photo upload, on the NFR-013 attachment fundament (#1339).

Mounted under ``/api/v1/t/{tenant_slug}/tasks/{key}/photos``, the same shape as
the REQ-034 plant gallery (``/plant-instances/{key}/photos``) so the frontend
consumes both the same way.

**Why this exists.** REQ-006 has required task photos since v1: ``requires_photo``
is on ``TaskTemplate`` and ``TaskItem``, ``photo_refs`` is on ``TaskItem``,
completion enforces the pair (``TaskService.complete_task`` refuses a
``requires_photo`` task with no photo), ``AttachmentCategory.TASK`` is in
NFR-013's category list and ``"task"`` is in the image-only MIME whitelist. Every
part of the capability was built **except the route**: the upload button on the
task-completion form posted to ``POST /tasks/{key}/photos``, which no router had
ever served, so a ``requires_photo`` task could not be completed at all — the
enforcement had no way to be satisfied. #1339 measured the 404; this is the
missing half.

**What it deliberately does not do.** It does not write ``task.photo_refs``. The
completion form stages its photos and submits the list with
``POST /tasks/{key}/complete``, which is what writes them and what the
``requires_photo`` gate reads; appending here as well would have the two writers
disagree the moment the user removes a staged photo before submitting. The
attachment itself is persisted and tenant-owned either way, so an abandoned
upload is a listed, deletable attachment rather than a lost object — though no
UI reaches that list for this category yet, which is #1393.

**What goes into ``photo_refs`` is the bare ``attachment_id``**, never the
``uri`` this response also carries. NFR-013 §2.2 and AC-09 define every
``photo_refs`` list — REQ-006's included — as a list of attachment ids, the
shipped ``migrate_photo_refs`` migration lists ``col.TASKS`` and rewrites exactly
the ``/attachments/{id}`` URI shape *back* to ids, and the diary sibling stores
ids and builds the URI at render. Storing the URI would have been wrong three
ways: a tenant rename re-derives the slug and would break every stored ref
permanently, running the migration would rewrite the refs into ids the client
then fetched verbatim, and the two photo features would disagree about their own
field. ``uri`` and ``thumbnail_uris`` are here for the immediate preview, which
needs no round trip.

Permissions (REQ-024 §1a — the "Attachments" matrix row, as for plant photos):
upload → ``Action.CREATE`` on ``ATTACHMENT``; a viewer is refused. The task is
loaded tenant-scoped *first*, so a foreign task key answers the same 404 as a
key that does not exist.

Responses expose only ``attachment_id`` plus stable tenant-scoped URIs — never
bucket / backend / storage-key details (NFR-013 AC-03/AC-04).

    The task is resolved tenant-scoped first, exactly as on the upload above, so an

    photos this route deletes are not in it yet. A photo already referenced by a
    completed task is deleted here too, and its id then dangles in ``photo_refs``;
    that is the same state a manual ``DELETE /attachments/{id}`` has always
    produced, and the readers resolve ids against the catalogue rather than trusting
