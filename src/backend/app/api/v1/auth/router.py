    """Bucket a rate limit on the *caller's* address, not on the proxy's.

    ``get_remote_address`` reads ``request.client.host``, which behind the
    Traefik ingress is the ingress for every caller alive — so every
    ``@limiter.limit`` in this module shared **one** bucket across the whole
    deployment. Ten failed pairing redemptions from any single source answered
    429 to everybody else for the rest of the minute (#1130, measured); the same
    held for login, registration and password reset, which is why the key is
    fixed here rather than on the one route the issue was filed against.

    ``resolve_client_ip`` is the same resolution the pairing **lockout** and the
    service-account ``ip_allowlist`` already use, so the three IP-based controls
    now agree on who the caller is instead of two of them disagreeing with the
    third.

    **What makes the key trustworthy** is `resolve_client_ip` itself, not an
    assumption about the ingress. An earlier version of this docstring claimed
    the ingress strips inbound ``X-Forwarded-*`` so the left-most entry could be
    trusted; that was refuted from this repository (``nginx.conf`` appends via
    ``$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for``, and no ``forwardedHeaders`` is pinned in
    ``helm/``), and #1151 replaced the reading with one that counts in from the
    trusted end. A caller who prepends entries only pushes their claim further
    out of reach.

    The one path that reading cannot cover is a request that never traverses our
    proxies — the backend NetworkPolicy currently admits port 8000 without a
    ``from`` selector (#1159). There the header is whatever its sender wrote, for
    this limiter as for the lockout and the allowlist.

    Falls back to the socket peer when no header is present, which is what a
    direct call (and every ``TestClient`` caller that sets no header) gets.

    token: the refresh token comes from the HttpOnly ``kp_refresh`` cookie, the
    CSRF double-submit is verified, the rotated token leaves as a cookie again
    and never appears in the JSON (AP-7 / FE-S1). The refusal order is the one
    this endpoint always had — a missing cookie answers 401 *before* CSRF is
    looked at, so nothing about the change is observable from the browser side.

    **Body transport (paired devices).** A device paired by QR code holds the raw
    refresh token in its platform keystore and has neither a cookie jar nor any
    way to obtain the ``csrf_token`` cookie. It presents the token as
    ``{"refresh_token": "…"}``; the response carries the rotated token in the
    body (``TokenPairResponse``) and sets **no** cookie — one credential on two
    transports would double its exposure and leave no single place that revokes
    it. Without this transport the pair minted by ``/device-pairing/redeem``
    would die 15 minutes later, unrotatable.

    **Why the body path needs no CSRF.** The double-submit defends *ambient*
    credentials: the browser attaches ``kp_refresh`` to a cross-site request on
    its own, so possession of the cookie proves nothing about who composed the
    request. A token in the body is not ambient — it must be read and typed in by
    the caller, and an attacker who can read this user's refresh token has the
    credential itself and needs no request forgery. (A cross-site page cannot
    even reach here: a JSON content type is not a CORS-simple request, so it is
    preflighted.)

    **Precedence, when both are present: the body wins and the cookie is ignored
    entirely.** Not "try the body, fall back to the cookie" — that fallback is
    the actual vulnerability, because a forged cross-site request carrying a
    junk body token would then spend the victim's ambient cookie with no CSRF
    header in sight. Here a request that names a body token is answered purely
    from that token: if it is invalid the answer is 401 and the cookie is left
    untouched and still valid. Nothing spends the ambient credential except the
