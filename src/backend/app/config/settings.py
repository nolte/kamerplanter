    #: Deliberately far below ``rate_limit_auth`` rather than equal to it. The
    #: ``/auth/*`` routes are interactive retry surfaces — a user who mistypes a
    #: password legitimately submits several times a minute — and their per-minute
    #: budget is sized for that. This endpoint is different in kind: every call
    #: mails a **caller-chosen address**, either the verification link (free
    #: address) or the "someone tried to use your address" notice (taken one), so
    #: its limit bounds outbound mail to third parties, not login retries.
    #: 20/minute would allow 1200 such mails an hour from one source. Changing an
    #: account's address is a rare, deliberate act; a handful of attempts an hour
    #: covers a typo plus a change of mind.
    rate_limit_email_change: str = "5/hour"
    #: ``POST /api/v1/privacy/email-change/confirm`` (REQ-025 Art. 16), per client IP.
    #:
    #: **Why there is a limit at all** (#990). The endpoint is unauthenticated and
    #: state-changing. The argument for leaving it alone — the token is 32 random
    #: bytes compared by hash, so guessing is not a realistic attack — is true
    #: today and is a property of *code*, which can change without anyone
    #: re-deriving this decision. A limit is cheap insurance that does not depend
    #: on that property holding.
    #:
    #: **Why not ``rate_limit_email_change``.** That one bounds outbound mail to a
    #: caller-chosen address, so its budget is cumulative and its window is an
    #: hour. Confirming sends no mail; it bounds token *attempts*, where the thing
    #: worth bounding is a burst from one source, not an hourly quota. An hourly
    #: budget would also keep punishing a legitimate user long after a retry storm
    #: spent it. A limit sized for a different threat is a limit nobody can reason
    #: about, so this is its own setting with its own window.
    #:
    #: **Where 10 comes from — the legitimate side, not the attacker side.** No
    #: per-IP figure makes a 2^256 token guessable or ungessable; an attacker with
    #: many source addresses is not bounded by anything ``get_remote_address`` can
    #: see. So the number is chosen as "comfortably above legitimate use, and no
    #: higher". Legitimate use is one request; a reload or a retry over a flaky
    #: connection makes two or three. Ten leaves room for several people
    #: confirming in the same minute behind one NAT — for an act each account
    #: performs a handful of times ever.
    #:
    #: **Link prefetching does not apply here**, which is the standard objection
    #: to a tight limit on a confirm link. Outlook Safe Links, Gmail's proxy and
    #: corporate URL detonation issue **GET** requests; this is a ``POST`` with a
    #: JSON body, so a prefetcher cannot spend the budget. A sandbox that renders
    #: the landing page and executes its JavaScript could — ten absorbs that too.
    rate_limit_email_change_confirm: str = "10/minute"
    #: ``POST /api/v1/auth/refresh``, per client IP (#1131).
    #:
    #: **Why its own setting and not ``rate_limit_auth``.** That budget's own
    #: docstring sizes it for "an interactive retry surface — a user who mistypes
    #: a password". Refresh is the opposite of interactive: ``AuthProvider``
    #: dispatches one on **every** app bootstrap — every tab, every reload, and
    #: anonymous visitors too (they get 401, but the limiter runs first and the
    #: attempt is spent) — plus one per 401 the interceptor retries. Behind a
    #: corporate NAT or CGNAT, twenty page loads a minute from one address is
    #: ordinary traffic, and the twenty-first would be refused.
    #:
    #: **Why a limit at all**, given that the token is a 512-bit-class secret
    #: looked up by hash: this is the only public token-*accepting* endpoint in
    #: ``/auth/*`` with a body transport (#1118), and every other one carries a
    #: budget. Defence in depth, sized so it cannot fire on legitimate use.
    rate_limit_token_refresh: str = "60/minute"
    #: ``POST /api/v1/auth/device-pairing/redeem`` (#1118), per client IP.
    #:
    #: **Why its own setting and not ``rate_limit_auth``.** The ``/auth/*`` budget
    #: is sized for an interactive retry surface — a user who mistypes a password
    #: legitimately submits several times a minute. Redemption is not that: the
    #: code is scanned from a QR image, so the legitimate client submits it
    #: **once**, and a second attempt only happens after re-scanning a fresh code.
    #: There is no typo to retry, hence no reason to fund twenty attempts a minute.
    #:
    #: **What it does and does not bound.** It bounds a burst from one source
    #: address; it is not what makes the 256-bit code unguessable (nothing per-IP
    #: is, against an attacker with many addresses — that is the code's entropy
    #: plus the 60–120 s TTL). The behavioural guard is the per-IP lockout in
    #: ``AuthService.redeem_device_pairing``; this limit sits in front of it so a
    #: flood never reaches the code store at all.
    #:
    #: **Where 10 comes from — the legitimate side.** One scan is one request.
    #: Ten leaves room for several people pairing devices in the same minute
    #: behind one NAT address, and stays deliberately below ``rate_limit_auth`` so
    #: the two surfaces cannot be confused for one budget.

    #: How many proxy addresses **our own** infrastructure appends to the right
    #: end of ``X-Forwarded-For`` (#1151).
    #:
    #: Every proxy in the chain appends, so the trustworthy entries sit at the
    #: right and anything a caller invents is pushed left. `resolve_client_ip`
    #: therefore counts in from the right by this many entries. Reading the
    #: *left-most* entry — what it did before — hands the caller the pen:
    #: ``nginx.conf`` proxies with ``$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for``, so a
    #: client-supplied header survives as the left-most value, and the controls
    #: that key on it (the device-pairing lockout, the service-account
    #: ``ip_allowlist``) could be walked around by rotating it.
    #:
    #:   * ``0`` — client → nginx → backend (the e2e and dev stacks): the caller
    #:     is the last entry, the one nginx wrote.
    #:   * ``1`` — client → ingress → nginx → backend (production): nginx
    #:     appended the ingress's address, so the caller is second to last.
    #:
    #: **The default is the shallow one deliberately.** Set too low, the resolved
    #: address drifts towards the nearest proxy and the controls bind more
    #: coarsely than intended — a degradation (this is the shared-bucket problem
    #: #1130 describes). Set too high, the resolver starts reading entries a
    #: caller can write — a bypass. A deployment that adds a hop must raise this;
    #: forgetting to is safe, forgetting the other direction is not.
    #:
    #: ``ge=0`` is not decoration: a negative value made `resolve_client_ip`
    #: index past the end of the chain and raise ``IndexError`` on every request
    #: carrying the header — a typo would have become an HTTP 500 crashloop on
    #: device pairing, MCP auth and service-account validation instead of a
    #: startup failure.
