        Read-modify-write, exactly like :meth:`ArangoTenantRepository.update_fields`:
        the stored ``User`` is loaded, ``fields`` is applied through
        ``model_copy(update=...)`` and the merged model is written via the
        inherited full-model :meth:`update`, which re-validates it in ``_to_doc``
        (#982/#996), strips ArangoDB system attributes and maps a 1202 onto
        :class:`NotFoundError`. That is the set of guards the platform-admin
        router bypassed by writing ``collection.update`` itself (#1018).

        **Caller obligation.** ``fields`` is applied key-by-key, so it must be
        built from named fields or a validated schema's ``model_dump()`` — never
        from a raw request body.

        Deliberately not the base class's dict-merge :meth:`update_fields`, which
        writes the dict straight through unchecked; materialising a full ``User``
        here is what gets the payload validated. The price is that method's
        lost-update commutativity for disjoint concurrent fields.

        Returns ``None`` when no user carries ``key``.
