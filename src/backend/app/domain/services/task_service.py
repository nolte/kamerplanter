# ── Update allow-lists (mass assignment, #965) ──
#
# The three ``update_*`` methods below used to loop over the caller's dict and
# ``setattr`` every entry onto the loaded model. That is mass assignment: the
# request body decided which *fields* were written, not the service — and since
# no domain model sets ``validate_assignment`` (#968), none of those writes was
# validated either. ``BaseArangoRepository.update_fields`` already states the
# obligation these sets discharge: a partial update must be built from an
# explicit allow-list, never from a raw body.
#
# Each set is the field list the corresponding request schema exposes, so no
# reachable edit is lost. What they keep out is what an editor must never move:
# identity and audit fields (``key``, ``created_at``, ``updated_at``), the
# ownership marker ``tenant_key`` and the ``is_system`` flag that guards the
# global catalog, and foreign references no route exposes (``activity_key``,
# ``phase_definition_key``) and which are therefore unverified.

#: Fields ``update_workflow_template`` may write (mirrors ``WorkflowTemplateUpdate``).

#: Fields ``update_workflow_phase`` may write (mirrors ``WorkflowPhaseUpdate``).

#: stays live on the update path instead of being dead code.
#:
#: **It is not reachable over HTTP, and that is left as it is (#964, #965).**
#: ``TaskTemplateUpdate`` does not declare the field, so Pydantic's
#: ``extra='ignore'`` drops it from a request body. Declaring it would make the
#: reference check genuinely reachable rather than accidentally unnecessary —
#: but it would also *widen* the write surface, and not only in theory: the SPA's
#: two inline editors (the enabled switch and the day-offset field) send
#: ``{...template, enabled: …}``, and ``TaskTemplateResponse`` carries
#: ``workflow_template_key``. Declaring the field turns that spread from
#: "silently ignored" into a re-point written on every toggle and every
#: keystroke, and any client posting a stale or partial template would move or
#: orphan it. The field therefore stays undeclared, and the guard stays live for
#: the non-HTTP callers that do reach this method.

          which raises ``NotFoundError`` for a template owned by another tenant —
          no cross-tenant oracle. It admits the global catalogue (``tenant_key ==
          ""``) so #324 is not re-broken. This runs *first*, so a foreign template
          is refused before it is ever classified by system-ness.
        * **System → 422.** The template's **current** parent decides whether the
          edit may happen at all: a seeded template of "Tomato Standard" is system
          data, so renaming or re-timing it is the same refusal as attaching a new
          one, only arriving by a different verb.
        * **Own → proceed.** The **target** parent is then checked as before, so a
          move can neither leave a system workflow's contents editable nor land in
          one.

        ``TaskTemplate`` carries no ``tenant_key`` of its own — ownership is not
        stored on the entity, exactly like ``Location``/``Slot``, which are
        verified through their parent site. The only anchor is the parent
        ``WorkflowTemplate`` behind ``workflow_template_key``, so the predicate
        hangs there. Hanging it on the template itself would match nothing and
        refuse every caller while looking like a working guard.

        Three answers, and the difference between them is deliberate:

        * **Foreign or unknown parent → 404.** Resolution goes through
          :meth:`get_workflow_template`, whose ``verify_tenant_read_access``
          answers ``NotFoundError`` for both, so this route cannot be used as a
          cross-tenant existence oracle.
        * **System workflow → 422.** A globally seeded workflow is visible to
          every tenant on purpose (#324: the strict direction must not hide the
          global catalogue), so it resolves — and then refuses the *write*, with
          the shared :data:`SYSTEM_WORKFLOW_CHILD_REFUSAL`. Deleting one of its
          task templates would remove it for every tenant.
        * **No parent at all → 404.** An activity plan's task templates always
          have one: ``ActivityPlanService.generate_plan`` assigns
          ``tt.workflow_template_key = wt.key`` to every template before it is
          persisted, and the seeder skips any template whose workflow it cannot
          resolve. A parentless template is therefore an unreachable state here,
          and it has no owner — so it is refused rather than left writable by
          anyone, which is what "no anchor, so no refusal" would mean on a route
          that has no tenant scoping of its own. The answer is the 404 rather
          than a 422 because "who owns this" has no answer: telling the caller
          the key exists but is unowned is the oracle the 404 avoids. The state
          is logged so it fails loudly where loudness helps — in the operator's
          log, not in an attacker's response body.

        * **A shared generated plan → the caller's private copy of it (#1003).**
          What ``ActivityPlanService`` persists is global (``tenant_key == ""``,
          ``is_system == False``), so #992 let every tenant write it — and every
          tenant write the *same* one. The write is not refused, because a
          generated plan is the user's working surface and they have no reason
          to expect it to be shared; it is redirected. See
          :meth:`_private_copy_for_a_shared_plan`.

        The plan ``ActivityPlanService`` generates is one global object that
        every tenant growing that species reads. #992 anchored the *route* on the
        parent workflow but left that object writable by all of them, so tenant
        A switching an activity off switched it off for tenant B, silently. The
        answer taken is **copy-on-write**: the generated plan stays a shared
        template, and a tenant's first write materialises a private copy which
        that tenant works on from then on.

        Three properties this has to hold, in order of how easily they break:

        1. **Idempotence.** The copy is materialised once. Every later write
           resolves the existing copy through the same lookup the *read* path
           uses (:meth:`ITaskRepository.get_auto_generated_workflow_for_species`),
           so the plan the caller edits and the plan the caller is shown can
           never be two different objects.
        2. **Stale keys keep working.** After the fork a client still holds the
           shared plan's task-template keys, and the SPA sends them on the next
           toggle. Such a key is mapped onto the copy through
           ``source_template_key`` rather than refused, so an open tab does not
           start writing the shared object again — which would be the original
           defect, reintroduced through the back door.
        3. **The source is never written.** Nothing here touches
           ``shared_plan``; the copy is built from it and only the copy is
           returned.

        A shared workflow that is *not* a generated plan cannot be forked — the
        copy would be unreachable, because the lookup that finds it keys on
        ``auto_generated`` and ``species_key``. That state is unreachable in
        practice (``auto_generated`` is set only by ``ActivityPlanEngine``, and
        ``generate_plan`` always stamps the species), so it is refused loudly
        with the same 404 an unowned template gets rather than written through,
        which would leave the shared object mutable exactly as before.
