        The code is a bearer credential for the seconds it lives: whoever

        from ``secrets`` with the same 256-bit budget as an API key — never from
        ``random``, never with a counter or a timestamp mixed in, because any
        predictable component would let a code be derived rather than guessed.

        Args:
            user_key: Account the code is bound to. Binding happens **here**, in
                the store, so redemption never has to trust a caller-supplied
                identity.
            ip_address: Source address of the issuing request, for the audit

        Returns:
            ``(code, expires_at)`` — the raw code, which the caller shows once

           the code store is touched — a locked-out caller must not be able to
           test a code at all, otherwise the lockout costs an attacker a status
           code and nothing else;
        2. only then consume the code (single-use, atomically, in the store);
        3. on a miss, count the failure and answer with the *same* generic
           error an unknown code gets, so "used", "expired" and "never existed"
           stay indistinguishable;
        4. on a hit, clear the counter — a valid code is proof of possession,
           and without the reset a household behind one NAT address would
           accumulate failures from mistyped codes until a legitimate pairing is
           refused.

        Args:
            code: The raw pairing code as scanned.
            user_agent: Client user agent, recorded on the session.
            ip_address: Source address; the throttle subject and the audit
                field. ``None`` falls back to a shared bucket rather than
                skipping the guard.
            device_name: Client-supplied label (operator decision, plan §Open
                questions 2). Validated here and **not yet persisted** —
                ``_create_tokens`` takes no device metadata; P5 adds the field
                to ``RefreshToken`` and wires it through.

        Returns:
            ``(token_pair, raw_refresh_token, is_persistent)``.
