"""GitHub's `email_verified` claim comes from `/user/emails` (#1403).

This branch had no test at all before #1403 rewrote it, and the pull-request
review found three defects living in exactly the untested part. The PR's own
thesis is that the original defect survived because its call site was untested;
shipping a rewritten branch with the same property would have been the same
mistake in the same change.

`/user` carries no verification flag. The address list does, one entry per
address, so the request is unconditional — a claim of `None` refuses the
auto-link, and leaving it absent for every GitHub caller with a public address
would switch auto-linking off for most of them.
