"""The OAuth auto-link reads the provider's `email_verified` claim (#1403).

`OAuthEngine.should_auto_link` always implemented the right rule and always had
tests for it — `(True, False) is False` has been green since the engine was
written. The defect was one level up: `AuthService.complete_oauth` supplied a
literal `True` for the second argument, so the engine's second parameter was
never fed anything a provider said. NFR-018 §1 in its purest form, and the
reason the engine's own test suite could not find it.

**This file exists because that call site had no test at all.** Everything below
drives `complete_oauth` end to end with doubled collaborators, so the assertion
is about what the service does with a claim rather than about what the engine
would do if it were given one.

The decision under test — an ABSENT claim refuses — is an operator decision from
2026-09-11 and a behaviour change for any installation whose provider omits the
claim. It is asserted here, stated on `should_auto_link`, and nowhere else.
