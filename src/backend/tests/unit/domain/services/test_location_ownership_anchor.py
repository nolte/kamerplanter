"""The shared Location/Slot ownership anchor, and that it has no private copies left (#1397).

``Location`` and ``Slot`` carry a ``tenant_key`` the write path never fills:
``LocationCreate`` may not declare one (``check_tenant_body_field``, #1000) and
``create_location`` does ``Location(**body.model_dump())``. Nine sites read that
empty field as if it meant something, failing in three directions — five refusing
the tenant's own data, two holding a condition that can never be true, one
projection answering ``null`` where a name belongs.

Two things are asserted here, and the second is the one that matters in a year:

1. The anchor answers correctly in both directions, with a control against the
   over-rejecting failure that made the whole class invisible (#706, #1352) — a
   guard that refuses everything passes every negative test ever written for it.
2. No module resolves ownership against ``location.tenant_key`` or
   ``slot.tenant_key`` again. That is a source sweep, not a behaviour test,
   because the failure mode is a *new* call site rather than a changed one.
