"""Tests for the route role-guard gate (``scripts/check_route_role_guards.py``).

**What is under test.** The parsing and the five rules, driven against
*constructed* miniature routers and decision tables written into ``tmp_path`` —
never against the real ``AppRoutes.tsx``. A test asserting "the router has 85
decided routes" would go red on the next legitimate route and teach nobody
anything; one case below does read the real pair, but only to assert that the
shipped tree passes, which is a property that must hold at every commit.

**The deliberately-broken router.** :class:`TestItCanFail` drops a wrapper the
table declares, adds a route nobody decided, and points the table at a route that
no longer exists — the three shapes #1261 is about — and asserts the check goes
red and names each. A gate nobody has watched fail is a gate nobody knows works.

**The second axis (#1336).** ``PLATFORM_ADMIN_ROUTES`` /
``<RequirePlatformAdmin>`` are checked with the same two directions, plus the one
that only exists once there are two axes: a wrapper of the *other* kind must not
satisfy an entry. REQ-049 §2.4 gives the domain rank and the platform attribute
no common rank, so a route "guarded" by the wrapper that answers the other
question is ungated in fact — :class:`TestTheAxesDoNotSubstitute` asserts the
check says so.

**The obsolete-entry direction is the half that rots.** A deleted route leaving
its decision behind turns the table into a pre-approval: the next route to re-use
that path inherits a judgement nobody made for it. Same rule, same reason, as
``check_layer_imports``' obsolete-allowlist entry.

**Why here.** ``pytest tests/unit/`` from ``src/backend`` is a CI check, and the
script lives outside the backend package, so it is loaded by path.

Traces to #1261 / REQ-049 §2.3 (no TC-ID: a source-tree gate is not a
user-facing case).
