"""The pest-detection writes are gated on role, not only on membership (#1333).

Three of the four write routes in
``app/api/v1/pest_detection/tenant_router.py`` resolved ``ctx`` through
``get_current_tenant`` and nothing else, while the fourth — ``create-inspection``,
in the same file — already carried ``require_permission(IPM_TREATMENT, CREATE)``.
So a **viewer** could upload an image that leaves the installation for a
third-party recognition service, do it in a loop, and alter the recorded outcome
of someone else's detection through ``feedback``.

That is #1256's argument for ``POST /identification/identify`` applied to the
same shape, and the sibling drift sat inside a single file — the class #948 cost
this repository months on.

These tests assert the DEPENDENCY, not a live HTTP round trip, for the reason
``test_recognition_write_gates`` states: the gate *is* a FastAPI dependency
default, and what goes wrong is a route carrying the wrong one. The companion
class then drives the resolved dependency with a viewer context, so a hollowed-out
``require_tenant_role`` cannot leave these green — the "wired but inert" failure.
