"""Every write route resolves its caller through a gate, or is allowlisted with a reason (#1353).

Nothing enumerated the write surface. `check_route_role_guards.py` covers the
frontend router against the decision table and says so in its own docstring — a
new backend gate does not turn it red. `check_tenant_body_field.py` covers body
schemas. `test_require_permission_enforcement.py` and
`test_req049_scope_enforcement.py` drive hand-picked endpoints. So a write route
added with a copied `Depends(get_current_tenant)` was green everywhere, and #948
— a guard opted into at the call site — kept recurring because opting in was the
only mechanism there was.

**Two selectors, not one.** #1353 describes the tenant-scoped half. That half
alone would never have reached `/api/v1/admin/settings` (#1385) or
`/api/v1/admin/oidc-providers` (#1399), both of which write installation-wide
configuration and both of which drifted exactly the same way. The admin half is
here for that reason, and it found #1399 on its first run.

**Why a test and not a `scripts/check_*.py` sweep.** The question is which
dependency a mounted route actually resolves, and that is a property of the
assembled app, not of a file. The AST sweep quoted in #1353 keyed on the filename
`tenant_router.py` and therefore missed three routes that live in
`nutrient_calculations/router.py` and `plant_instances/diary_router.py` — the
same opt-in-list hole the sweep exists to close, one level up.

**The allowlist is the interesting half.** Not every ungated write route is a
defect: per-user state, a data-subject right, and POST-as-computation are all
legitimately open to any member. What was missing is anyone having written down
*which is which*. Each entry below carries its reason, and an entry that no
longer matches a route fails — the obsolescence rule `check_layer_imports` and
`check_route_role_guards` already follow.

#: THE THIRD QUESTION (#1402), and it is a different one from the two above.
#:
#: Both selectors above key on the PRESENCE of a specific weak dependency: the
#: tenant half asks whether `ctx` IS `get_current_tenant`, the admin half whether
#: `get_current_user` appears. A route carrying NO dependency at all fails both
#: tests in the passing direction, and 133 write operations lie outside both
#: prefixes besides. Measured on 2026-09-12, before this question existed:
#: **24** of 439 mounted write operations resolved no authorisation dependency
#: anywhere — fourteen of them not deliberately public. Seven were the
#: calculators under `/api/v1/calculations`, invisible because they fall through
#: both prefixes; seven were under `/t/{tenant_slug}/nutrient-calculations`,
#: which the tenant selector SEES and does not report. Three of those seven also
#: read the fertilizer catalogue with `FertilizerService.get_fertilizer`'s
#: `tenant_key=""` default, which skips its own ownership check.
#:
#: This question asks instead: does the effective dependency chain of this write
#: operation contain ANY authorisation dependency? It reads `route.dependant`
#: transitively rather than `inspect.signature`, so a router-level
#: `APIRouter(dependencies=[...])` counts — which is how the fourteen were fixed,
#: and a per-handler read would have reported them as still open.
#:
#: It is deliberately coarse. "Carries some authorisation" is not "carries the
#: RIGHT authorisation": the installation-wide master data behind bare
#: `get_current_user` (#1402 group B) passes this question and is still a defect.
#: A coarse question that cannot be fooled by absence is worth more than a
#: precise one with a hole, and the precise one is the next refinement.
#: Dependencies that actually REFUSE a caller, by qualified name. A set of exact
#: names and not substring markers, because the first version of this list used
#: substrings and three of them were wrong in the permissive direction: `"mcp_"`
#: matched `require_mcp_enabled` (an operator feature flag that 404s when MCP is
#: off and authorises nobody when it is on) plus `get_mcp_dispatcher` and
#: `get_mcp_session_store`; `"api_key"` matched the `APIKeyHeader` scheme object,
#: which carries `auto_error=False` and therefore never refuses anything. No route
#: was saved by a weak match alone when this was found, so it was latent — but a
#: write route added under `/api/v1/mcp` carrying only `get_mcp_dispatcher` would
#: have counted as authorised and been anonymously reachable.
#:
#: `__qualname__` rather than `__name__`: the three `require_*` factories all
#: return a closure called `_check`, indistinguishable by name and exact by
#: qualified name.

#: THE FOURTH QUESTION (#1402 group B): installation-wide master data.
#:
#: These routers are mounted globally and every row in them is shared by the whole
#: installation — one `GrowthPhase` is the phase REQ-003's state machine runs on,
#: for everyone. They carried `APIRouter(dependencies=[Depends(get_current_user)])`
#: and no role gate, so any authenticated member of any tenant could create, change
#: or delete them. Their immediate siblings `companion_planting` and
#: `family_relationships` gated every write on `require_platform_admin` all along,
#: which is what made the omission visible rather than arguable.
#:
#: The third question passes them: `get_current_user` *is* authorisation, just not
#: enough of it. This one asks the narrower thing.
#:
#: **Scoped to a named set of modules, deliberately.** Measured on this tree, 133
#: write operations lie outside both the tenant and the admin prefix, and 117 of
#: them resolve only `get_current_user`. Most are legitimately member-writable — a
#: caller creates their own tenant, exercises their own data-subject rights, edits
#: their own profile — so a blanket rule here would be wrong in more places than it
#: is right. The remaining triage is #1402's own follow-up.
#:
#: What this does close is the per-route drift: a new write route added to any of
#: these seven inherits nothing, and this test names it. A new *module* of the same
#: kind is not covered, which is a rarer event than a new route and is said out
#: loud rather than implied.
