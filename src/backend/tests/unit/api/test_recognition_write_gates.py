"""The recognition writes are gated on role, not only on membership (#1256).

Until #1256 three of the four write routes resolved `ctx` through
`get_current_tenant` and nothing else, so a **viewer** could identify a plant,
select one of the results, and link it to a plant instance. `POST /reference`,
three lines below the first offender, already carried
`require_tenant_role(TenantRole.GROWER)` — the mechanism was present, the routes
simply never got it.

These tests assert the DEPENDENCY, not a live HTTP round trip. The gate is a
FastAPI dependency default, and what went wrong was that a route carried the
wrong one; reading the declared default is therefore the shortest statement of
the rule that can fail when someone swaps it back. A companion test drives the
resolved dependency with a viewer context, so the assertion is not merely "some
callable is attached".
