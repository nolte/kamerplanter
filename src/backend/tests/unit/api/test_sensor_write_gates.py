"""The sensor write routes exist, are parent-scoped, and are role-gated (#1339).

Until #1339 a sensor could be **created and read and never changed or removed**:
there was no update or delete route at any prefix, while three detail pages and
an edit dialog offered both. This file pins the three properties of the repair
that a later edit could silently drop.

1. **The routes exist, on every parent.** Sensors hang off tanks, sites *and*
   locations, and the create routes already did so on all three. Adding the pair
   to whichever parent happened to be in front of the author is #948 exactly —
   two of four sibling routes repaired, the other two left open for months — so
   the pairing is asserted as a *set*, from the mounted route table.

2. **The role gate is the one REQ-049 §2.3 prescribes**: update reaches
   ``require_permission(..., UPDATE)`` (lead or grower), delete reaches
   ``require_permission(..., DELETE)`` (**lead only** — the irreversibility
   boundary). Reading the declared dependency is the shortest statement of the
   rule that can fail when someone swaps it back; a companion class drives the
   resolved dependency with each role, so the assertion is not merely "some
   callable is attached" (the wired-but-inert failure class).

3. **The parent is passed to the service, and named correctly.** A route that
   verifies its tank and then hands the service ``parent_field="site_key"``
   would pass both checks above and still be a cross-tenant write. The handlers
   are therefore called with doubles, and what reaches the service is asserted.

No TC-ID: these are route-surface invariants, not user-facing cases.
