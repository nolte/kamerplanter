"""The build identity is wired from the CI build to the endpoint — and nowhere else (#1210).

Structural tests. The "unit" is the *chain* that carries a git SHA from a GitHub
Actions build into `GET /api/health`, so the collaborators are the source texts
of the three files that make up that chain, read once and parsed — no Docker
daemon, no network, no running app.

Why structural rather than behavioural
--------------------------------------
The behavioural test would be "build the image, run it, curl the endpoint". That
needs a Docker build in the unit tier, and it is precisely the test that would
*not* have caught this class of defect anyway: every link here fails **silently
and green**. Drop the `build-args:` line and the image builds fine, starts fine,
serves fine — and reports `"unknown"` forever. Move the `ARG` above the pip layer
and every build still works, just slower. Nothing goes red on its own, which is
why the chain is pinned link by link.

The falsification these tests are built for
-------------------------------------------
Criterion 7 of the work package: *reverting only the `build-args:` line in
`docker-publish.yml` must make the endpoint stop reporting the real SHA.*
`TestTheWorkflowPassesTheRevisionIn` fails on exactly that edit, and on nothing
else. Its counterpart `TestTheDockerfileAcceptsTheRevision` fails if the image
stops accepting the value. Together they establish the property no runtime test
in this repository can: that the SHA comes from the *build*, not from a default
that would look identical in every assertion made against a running process.

The third class, `TestTheRevisionDoesNotLeakIntoTheContractVersion`, is an
absence guard over `app/main.py`. `settings.app_version` has six consumers — the
Sentry release, the startup log, the mDNS advertisement, `FastAPI(version=…)`,
the health payload and the Celery worker's release. Four of those are unreachable
from a TestClient (they run at import time or inside the lifespan), so "the build
SHA did not leak into the mDNS advertisement" is not checkable at runtime here.
It is checkable in the source, and that is what the AST scan does.
