"""Tests for the deployed-build check (``scripts/ci/check_deployed_build.py``).

**What this guards.** Hop 4 of the delivery chain — *does the running pod serve
the bytes its chart version pins?* — is the only hop nothing measured, and the
one the 2026-08-17 incident failed on while the hop-3 digest guard stayed green
and correct (#1236).

**The defect this file is shaped against.** An earlier, unreviewed version of
the script took its expected build from ``helm/kamerplanter/values.yaml`` — this
repository's ``develop`` channel — and compared it against production, which
tracks a *published chart version*. Measured on 2026-09-01 the two were
``sha256:e2b0aec4…`` (revision ``37cbc06f…``) and ``sha256:f1059661…`` (revision
``07502fd7…``): the check would have reported permanent "drift" for ordinary
release lag while hop 4 was in fact clean. :class:`TestTheOperandIsTheDeployedChart`
is the absence guard for that; it fails the moment the script learns to read the
repository chart again.

**What is under test.** The decision logic and the resolution paths, driven
against a constructed in-memory registry and health endpoint — never against
ghcr.io and never against a real instance. A test that reached either would
answer a question about today's deployment state rather than about the check,
and would go red on the next publish.

**The doubles are deliberately not more permissive than the real things.**
:class:`FakeRegistry` demands a bearer token on every ``/v2/`` request, 404s an
unknown tag or digest, carries the buildx attestation entry
(``platform: unknown/unknown``) that GHCR really serves so the platform filter is
exercised rather than assumed away, and serves the chart layer as **real gzip'd
tar bytes** so ``gzip``/``tarfile``/``yaml`` run for real. The recurring failure
in this repository is a double that accepts input the real thing rejects, which
turns a positive test into a certificate of nothing.

**Why here.** The script lives outside the backend package (it is a repository
tool, not application code), but ``pytest tests/unit/`` is the tier that runs in
CI, so the test lives here and loads the script by path — the same arrangement
as ``test_digest_freshness_check.py``. Traces to #1236 (no TC-ID: a repository
tool is not a user-facing case).
