"""Physical invariants of `substrates.yaml` that a JSON Schema cannot express (#1152).

The file declared no schema and shipped three physically impossible records: air
porosity plus water-holding capacity above 100 %, on the same pore space. Adding
`substrates.schema.yaml` pins structure, types and per-field ranges — but every
invariant that actually catches these defects is **cross-field**, and JSON Schema
has no arithmetic across properties. So the schema and this module are two halves
of one check, and a green schema run alone means less than it looks like.

Each rule below is asserted twice: once as a rule, against fixtures that sit on
its boundary, and once over the real seed file. The first is what makes the
boundary a decision rather than an accident of the data; the second is what makes
it bite.

Not covered here: the CEC plausibility band. Its *unit* is settled — the values
are per 100 cm³ of volume, the field is named ``cec_meq_per_100cm3`` and the mix
engine weights it by volume (#1152 §F) — but a per-type band still is not, and
writing one from the values present would only ratify them. The literature
figures in REQ-019 are mass-based (meq/100 g) and converting them needs each
source's own bulk density, which those sources mostly do not report; assembling
that table across fourteen substrate types is a data job, not an inference, and
#1175 deliberately leaves it rather than guessing a band. The one record that
fits neither reading is named in #1152 §F: sphagnum at CEC 8 and 30 g/L implies
267 meq/100 g, above its band, which is a second reason a band derived from this
data would be wrong.
