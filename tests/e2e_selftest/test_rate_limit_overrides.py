"""Every per-IP rate limit that gates a route is a decision for this harness.

The E2E stack violates the assumption every one of these limits is sized for.
They are keyed on the **client IP**, and in production one address is roughly one
human. Here four xdist workers drive four browsers through a single Selenium
node, so the backend sees the whole suite as one very busy client.

That is not hypothetical. Measured on the 2026-08-15 nightly (`e2e-nightly` run
31859469145, profile `full`): 4 137 calls to `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`, **289
refused with 429**, against a 60/minute budget whose *median* load was 34/minute.
The refusals came from bursts — four browsers navigating together exhaust a
minute's budget in seconds. A refused refresh drops the browser to logged-out, and
every later `page.open()` times out waiting for a page it never reaches: 119
failures, every one a `TimeoutException`, evenly spread over the four workers
(30/30/30/29), and only in the three profiles that authenticate.

`RATE_LIMIT_AUTH` had already been raised for the login path, for exactly this
reason. The refresh path — the busier of the two, since `AuthProvider` dispatches
one refresh per app bootstrap and an E2E suite bootstraps on every page open — was
missed, and nothing noticed for as long as it stayed just under the budget.

So this file makes the omission impossible rather than unlikely: a new
rate-limited route must be classified once, here, as either raised for the harness
or deliberately left at production level. The list below is the record of those
decisions, not a description of the status quo.
