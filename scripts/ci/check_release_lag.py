"""Alert when `develop` carries commits that no PUBLISHED release contains.

Issue #1210. Production does not track `develop`; it tracks a **release tag** —
the ArgoCD `Application` in `nolte/k8s-home-lab` pins `targetRevision` to a
published tag for `path: helm/kamerplanter`. That is intended: production rolls
out release versions only. The consequence nothing in this repository could see
until now is that a merged fix is not a delivered fix, and the gap between the
two is invisible.

THE INCIDENT THIS EXISTS FOR
----------------------------
PR #1163 merged to `develop` on 2026-08-14T20:50Z, repairing two MCP tools that
returned 500. On 2026-08-16T12:00Z an operator hit the identical bug on the
running instance and re-diagnosed it from scratch. The fix was correct and
merged; it had simply never been delivered — the newest *published* release was
still `v0.2.0` (2026-08-13T18:09Z), and `v0.2.1` existed only as an **unpublished
draft**. Two days of invisibility, ended by re-encountering the bug.

The draft is the trap. `release-drafter.yml` keeps a draft current on every push
to `develop`, and `release-publish.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only — publishing
is a manual hop. So the repository's most visible release artefact is a draft
that reads as done and delivers nothing. `gh release list` prints `v0.2.1 Draft`;
this script therefore refuses to count a draft (or a prerelease) as a delivery,
and the report names the draft explicitly so the alert cannot be misread as
"a release exists, so we are fine".

WHAT COUNTS AS LAG
------------------
Lag is alertable when BOTH hold:

  1. the comparison `<newest published tag>...<base branch>` is ahead by at
     least one commit, AND
  2. the **oldest** of those un-released commits is at least
     RELEASE_LAG_THRESHOLD_DAYS old (default 3).

The grace window (2) is the point of the threshold, exactly as in
scripts/ci/check_digest_freshness.py: `develop` is ahead of the last release
almost all of the time, and alerting on that would be alerting on normal
development. What is not normal is a commit sitting undelivered for days. The
oldest un-released commit — not the newest, not the release date — is the right
clock, because it is the answer to "how long has the earliest undelivered change
been waiting?", which is precisely what nobody could answer on 2026-08-16.

A MEASURED LIMIT OF THE DEFAULT WINDOW, STATED HONESTLY
-------------------------------------------------------
With the default 3-day window this check would NOT have fired at the moment of
re-encounter: #1163's merge commit was ~1.6 days old on 2026-08-16T12:00Z. It
would have fired on 2026-08-17T20:50Z, roughly a day later — still far sooner
than "somebody hits the bug again", but not instantly. The unit tests pin BOTH
facts (see test_release_lag_check.py::TestTheIncident) rather than quietly
choosing a window that flatters the check. Tune RELEASE_LAG_THRESHOLD_DAYS if a
tighter window is wanted; the trade is alerting on ordinary weekend development.

WHY THE API AND NOT GIT
-----------------------
Everything is read from the GitHub REST API: the release list to find the newest
published release, and the compare endpoint to enumerate the commits `develop`
carries beyond that release's tag. No git operations at all, so this runs
correctly on the default shallow checkout, needs no tag fetch, and stays
injectable end-to-end in the unit tests (no network, no live git).

FAIL LOUD (NFR-018 section 2)
-----------------------------
An unreachable API, an unparseable release list, no published release at all, an
unparseable comparison, or a tag that cannot be resolved to a commit is NOT
"no lag". It raises, main() prints ``::error::`` and exits non-zero WITHOUT
writing the report — the workflow run goes red and opens NO issue. An
undetermined check must never read as a clean one, and a transient API blip must
not spam the tracker.
