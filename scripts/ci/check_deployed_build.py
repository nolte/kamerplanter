"""Ask a running instance whether it serves the build its chart version pins.

Issue #1236 — the LAST hop of the delivery chain, and the only one nothing
measures. A merge reaches a cluster in four hops::

    merge -> docker-publish (GHCR) -> Renovate digest PR (chart pin) -> ArgoCD sync

``scripts/ci/check_digest_freshness.py`` measures hop 3: is the digest in
``helm/kamerplanter/values.yaml`` still the one GHCR serves for its channel? It
was **green throughout the 2026-08-17 incident, and correctly so** — the chart
pinned a perfectly good build. Nobody measured hop 4: does the *pod* run those
bytes? It did not, for days, and it surfaced only when an operator re-triggered
a bug a merged fix had already removed.

This script asks the instance itself, comparing two values that are the same
40-character git SHA by construction:

  (a) ``org.opencontainers.image.revision`` on the deployed image, written by
      ``docker/metadata-action`` from ``github.sha``; and
  (b) ``build_revision`` from ``GET <instance>/api/health``, baked into the image
      by ``src/backend/Dockerfile`` (``ARG``/``ENV BUILD_REVISION``) from
      ``docker-publish.yml`` (``build-args: BUILD_REVISION=${{ github.sha }}``).

Both come from the same expression in the same build, so they are compared in
full. There is no truncation rule anywhere, deliberately: a truncation rule is a
thing to get wrong. Measured on 2026-09-01 against the reference deployment, the
two sides agree exactly — image ``sha256:f1059661…`` annotates
``07502fd7510dc32de2bbfdd6fd178ec2041e56a9`` and bakes
``BUILD_REVISION=07502fd7510dc32de2bbfdd6fd178ec2041e56a9``.

WHY THIS IS NOT A GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW (#1236, measured 2026-09-01)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A predecessor of this script was a scheduled workflow reading
``vars.DEPLOYED_INSTANCE_URL``. That shape was refuted on two independent counts
and the workflow is deliberately absent:

1. **A GitHub-hosted runner cannot reach the instance.** The reference
   deployment answers on ``https://kamerplanter.just-a-lab.duckdns.org``, whose
   A record — from ``8.8.8.8``, ``1.1.1.1`` and ``9.9.9.9`` alike — is
   ``192.168.178.166``, an RFC1918 address. The repository has no self-hosted
   runners (``gh api …/actions/runners`` → ``total_count: 0``). A hosted runner
   would time out; a runner that *did* own ``192.168.178.0/24`` would silently
   measure some other machine. The second failure mode is worse than the first.
2. **The repository's own chart pin is the wrong operand.** Production tracks a
   *published chart version* (ArgoCD ``targetRevision: 0.2.1`` against
   ``oci://ghcr.io/nolte/charts/kamerplanter``), not the ``develop`` channel that
   ``helm/kamerplanter/values.yaml`` carries. On 2026-09-01 the repository chart
   pinned ``sha256:e2b0aec4…`` (revision ``37cbc06f…``, channel ``develop``)
   while the released chart 0.2.1 pinned ``sha256:f1059661…`` (revision
   ``07502fd7…``) and the pod ran exactly that. A check comparing the repository
   chart against production would have reported permanent "drift" for what is
   ordinary release lag — a lane ``release-lag.yml`` already watches — while hop
   4 was in fact clean.

So the expected build is named by ``--chart-version``: the chart version the
deployment actually targets. This runs where the instance is reachable — an
operator workstation (``task verify:deployed-build``) or a job inside the
cluster — and never assumes CI can see the far end.

THE ORDERING / IDENTITY ANCHOR
------------------------------
A check that reads two operands at two moments can report a mismatch that was
already resolved, or a match that no longer holds. Here the two sides are
deliberately asymmetric:

* **The expected side has no read-time at all.** ``--chart-version`` names a
  released, immutable chart; the image digest inside it is content-addressed and
  the revision annotation is a property of those bytes. Reading it earlier or
  later yields the same answer, so it contributes no window. The resolved chart
  manifest digest is recorded in the report so the measurement is reproducible
  from the report alone. A *pre-release* version (``0.2.1-dev``) is the one
  exception — that OCI tag is rewritten by every ``helm/**`` merge — and is
  reported as a caveat rather than silently treated as immutable.
* **The instance side is a fact about one instant**, and only that instant. A
  ``drift`` verdict can therefore be stale-positive (fixed between the read and
  the reader); it cannot be a false negative about the instant it names.

There is a second, sharper anchor problem that a single request cannot see: a
Deployment mid-rollout has **old and new pods behind the same Service**, so one
``GET /api/health`` samples whichever replica the Service happened to pick. A
one-shot check is therefore non-deterministic exactly when the system is in
transition — it reports ``match`` or ``drift`` by luck of the draw. This script
samples ``--samples`` times (default 3) and treats the *set* of revisions it saw
as the measurement:

* one distinct revision -> the ordinary comparison;
* several, one of which is expected -> ``rolling`` **while the expected image is
  younger than the grace window**: some replicas already serve it, others do
  not, which is what a rollout looks like. Past that window a still-split
  Service is ``drift`` on the replicas that never rolled — a rollout does not
  take a day, and letting ``rolling`` swallow it would give this check a
  permanent blind spot in a partial hop-4 failure;
* several, none expected -> ``drift``, and every observed revision is reported.

Sampling widens the window; it does not close it. Against a single-replica
Deployment every sample necessarily hits the same pod, and a Service can route
several samples to one replica by chance. Stated here rather than silently
assumed.

THE INSTANCE HAS THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO
---------------------------------------
``build_revision`` is disclosed only when the instance sets
``HEALTH_EXPOSE_BUILD_REVISION``. The three well-formed replies mean three
different things and must never be collapsed:

``no build_revision key at all``
    The instance was configured not to disclose its build. **Nothing is wrong
    with the deployment** — but this check cannot run against it. Raises
    :class:`BuildRevisionNotDisclosedError`: loud, and with a message naming the
    setting rather than anything resembling drift.
``"unknown"``
    The instance is willing to disclose, but no build stamped a revision into
    the image (a dev image, or a build without the ``BUILD_REVISION`` build-arg).
    The measurement is undetermined: loud, and no verdict.
``a 40-character hex SHA``
    The real answer. The only reply that reaches :func:`decide`.

WHY "NOT DISCLOSED" IS LOUD AND NOT A GREEN WARNING
---------------------------------------------------
Running this check **is** the statement "I want hop 4 answered". If the far end
declines to answer, the check is not running — and NFR-018 §2's thesis is that a
check which cannot report a failure is indistinguishable from one that is not
running. A green result saying "not disclosed" is exactly that shape.

Until 2026-09-01 that made the check inert against the reference deployment,
which is the trap #1236 predicted. ``helm/kamerplanter/values.yaml`` now carries
``HEALTH_EXPOSE_BUILD_REVISION: "true"`` as a chart default, so the setting
arrives with the chart and needs no action in the GitOps repository. Verified by
rendering the released chart 0.2.1 with the production ``Application``'s own
``valuesObject``: the chart default and every operator override survive the same
Helm merge. The disclosure trade — the mapping *this host runs that commit*
yields the exact patch distance to ``develop`` — is the one this repository's own
documentation already recommends taking for an auditable production instance.

FAIL LOUD (NFR-018 §2)
----------------------
An unreachable instance, a reply that is not a Kamerplanter health payload, an
undisclosed or ``"unknown"`` revision, a revision that is not a full SHA, a chart
version that cannot be resolved, a missing revision annotation, a missing
``created`` timestamp or an unparseable manifest is NOT "no drift". It raises,
:func:`run` prints ``::error::`` and exits :data:`EXIT_UNDETERMINED` **without
writing the report**, so a consumer that acts on the report cannot mistake an
undetermined check for a clean one.

Exit codes are the alert here, because — unlike the three shipped watchers —
there is no workflow step to carry it into an issue: :data:`EXIT_OK` for
``match``/``within_grace``/``rolling``, :data:`EXIT_DRIFT` for the incident,
:data:`EXIT_UNDETERMINED` for anything undetermined, :data:`EXIT_USAGE` for a
bad invocation.

The registry plumbing below deliberately duplicates
``check_digest_freshness.py`` rather than importing it: the two answer different
questions of the same registry on different schedules, and a change to the
pin-freshness job must not silently alter this one.
